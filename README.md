# A holistic perspective on genomic diversity in Aotearoa New Zealand's most threatened breeding bird
The current fairy tern species complex is comprised of three subspecies, the Australian fairy tern (*Sterna nereis nereis*), New Zealand fairy tern | tara iti (*S. n. davisae*), and the New Caledonian fairy tern (*S. n. exsul*). Population monitoring for each of the three taxa indicate that populations are declining (Australia and New Caledonia), or are chronically small (n <=30 tara iti adults).  

There remain questions around the relative population diversity and differentiation among the three taxa. Here, we examine samples collected from the largest (Western Australia) and smallest (tara iti) recorded fairy tern populations as a 'first-look' into fairy tern genomic diversity. We also examine genomic diversity for a subset of individuals from Galla et al. (2020) using an improved genome asembly for kakÄ« (*Himantopus novaezelandiae*).
