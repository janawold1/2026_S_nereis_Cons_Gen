# Population genomics of Australian fairy tern and tara iti
The current fairy tern species complex is comprised of three subspecies, the Australian fairy tern (*Sterna nereis nereis*), New Zealand fairy tern | tara iti (*Sterna nereis davisae*), and the New Caledonian fairy tern (*Sterna nereis exsul*). Population monitoring for each of the three taxa indicate that populations are declining (Australia and New Caledonia), or are chronically small (n <=30 tara iti adults).  

There remain questions around the relative population diversity and differentiation among the three taxa. Here, we examine samples collected from the largest (Western Australia) and smallest (tara iti) recorded fairy tern populations as a 'first-look' into fairy tern genomic diversity.
