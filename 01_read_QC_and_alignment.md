## Alignment
### Standard alignments
Alignments to the tara iti reference assembly and common tern genome assembly.  

#### Tara iti Reference Genome

#### Common Tern Reference Genome


### Comparing tara iti genome with Common Tern assembly
Tara iti reference genome scaffolded as per the VGP Common Tern genome assembly. This was accomplished by whole-genome alignement with Mashmap v2.0 as implemented in [D-GENIES](dgenies.toulouse.inra.fr).
